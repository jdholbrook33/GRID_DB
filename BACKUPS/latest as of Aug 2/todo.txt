1. Make a button for "create new or new record" just to make it obvious what they should do. It can actually be the "add row" function but as a button.
2. Bring in the OrderDetail table and figure out how to make it show correctly.. I mean organized by WorkOrder number with something to set each work order number group apart. Color or spaces or something.
3. More data verification. EmployeeID needs to be 4 digits, no more, no less and no letters allowed and there are others such as zip code.
4. What about a rollover function that as the mouse rolls over a row, the entire row is magnified a little.
5. I like the colors but we'll need to work on them just a bit and what about some cool animation in the background? Like falling snow or Lissajous curve.
6. Set it up so that it runs when the machine is fired up and is available on any computer in the network.
7. We will eventually have to have authentication or even levels such that you can't view, can view but not edit, can edit some, can edit all. 
8. State Name drop down so the user can pick the state and the certified abbreviation is actually saved, the table is there already, StateNames.
9. ProductUnit will need to be a drop down in the Inventory table page to keep the Units standardized.
